This program is meant to simulate a robot that has one motor and four arms.  The
exercise is to ensure that a command, once started is completed so that each arm
can use the motor in an atomic and interweaved manner.  Picture a set of robot
arms manipulating a tubular frame for a car and the arms are welding it
together. It would be impossible to do this if one arm started all its tasks
then the next arm etc. An accurately placed weld depends on the frame being
fabricated to a certain point, therefore threads are necessary to interact.
